# Matrix-Calculus-For-Deep-Learning
I go through paper "The Matrix Calculus You Need For Deep Learning" by Howard and Terence. In this repository I have put my notes of paper and blog on paper.

\[ \frac{d}{dx} 9(x + x^2) = 9 \frac{d}{dx}(x + x^2) = 9 (\frac{d}{dx}x + \frac{d}{dx}x^2) = 9(1 + 2x) = 9 + 18x \]


\frac{d}{dx} 9(x + x^2)
